# Cursor Rules for ML Sentiment Feedback Loop Microservices Project

## CODE STYLE

- Write code concisely and directly, like an experienced engineer.
- Avoid unnecessary comments. Only comment when the logic is non-obvious.
- Do NOT generate markdown documents unless explicitly requested instaed answer for question in chat itself.
- Prefer simplicity over abstraction unless the user specifies architecture patterns.
- Do NOT over-explain decisions. Produce clean code, not lessons.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

- All microservices must follow the template:
  /services/<service-name>/
  app/main.py
  requirements.txt
  Dockerfile

- Root must contain:
  docker-compose.yml
  README.md only when explicitly requested.

- Never invent new folders, configs, or technologies unless the user says so.

## FASTAPI & PYTHON

- Use FastAPI for all services.
- Use pydantic models only when endpoints require structured input.
- Keep endpoints minimal:
  - /health for each service
  - logical endpoints only when the user requests them
- Avoid unnecessary routers or large frameworks unless instructed.

## DOCKER

- Every service must have:

  - python:3.11-slim as base
  - requirements installation
  - uvicorn as entrypoint

- Keep Dockerfiles short—no unnecessary layers.

## AWS / CLOUD

- When integrating AWS (S3, Lambda, SNS, etc.), generate only the minimal working code.
- Never generate full IaC unless the user asks.
- When writing AWS-related code, avoid mock explanations.

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

- When the user asks for a change:

  - Modify only what they ask.
  - Do NOT rewrite the entire file unless requested.

- When generating multiple files:
  - Print them cleanly with file paths as headers.
  - Do NOT wrap in Markdown unless requested.

## ERROR HANDLING

- Keep error handling minimal and practical.
- Avoid writing try/except blocks unless needed.

## GENERAL RULES

- Never create placeholder text like “TODO”.
- Never produce academic explanations unless asked.
- If the user asks for a step-by-step plan, give steps concisely.
- Prioritize functional, deployable code over verbosity.

## PROHIBITED

- Do NOT:
  - auto-create schemas, docs, prompts, or README files
  - add verbose comments
  - add teaching explanations
  - output analysis unless asked
  - generate long markdown guides by default

## WHEN UNSURE

- Ask a precise clarification question instead of guessing.
